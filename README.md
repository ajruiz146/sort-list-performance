## Project
Performance comparison of sorting methods with sorted and unsorted lists :
- Bubble sort
- Insertion sort
- Selection sort
- Merge sort
- Quick sort
The performance comparison is based in multi-test and the mean of the time results.
Finally we obtain the result in a coordinate graph.

## Project setup
```
cd project
```
```
python3 main.py
```
PyCharm IDE - ctrl + f5

## Project config
- PERFORMANCE_FUNCTIONS = We can change the sort methods adding or removing the function to the project and the function name here.
- N_TIMES = Number of times that we want to test each method, more times more results fiability.
- LENGTHS = Items number of the array test
