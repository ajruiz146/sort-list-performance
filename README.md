# sort-list-performance
## Project
Performance comparison of sorting methods with sorted and unsorted lists :
- Bubble sort
- Insertion sort
- Selection sort
- Merge sort
- Quick sort
The performance comparison is based in multi-test and the mean of the time results.
Finally we obtain the result in a coordinate graph.
